# Personal Finance Tracker - Project Context

## About Me

**Name:** Krish Soni
**Current Status:** Junior in high school (11th grade)
**Location:** Working from `/Users/kmoney/Code/`
**Coding Experience:** Complete beginner - just built my first website ever

### Background & Goals

- **Career Interest:** Exploring the intersection of finance and technology
- **Long-term Goal:** Either work in high finance OR build tech products in the finance space
- **Main Motivation:** Build valuable skills and create opportunities to make money after graduation
- **Current Exploration:** Figuring out if I enjoy building products with code vs traditional finance career

### Sports/Interests
- Soccer, Basketball, Golf
- Business and entrepreneurship
- Want to run my own company eventually

## My Coding Journey So Far

### What I've Learned (Last Few Hours)
1. ✅ Installed Node.js and npm
2. ✅ Created my first Next.js application (personal website)
3. ✅ Learned basic React/TypeScript syntax
4. ✅ Used Tailwind CSS for styling
5. ✅ Pushed code to GitHub for the first time
6. ✅ Deployed a website to Vercel

### Current Technical Knowledge
- **Can do:** Basic Next.js components, Tailwind styling, Git commands, deployment
- **Understand:** Functions, components, props, className styling, HTML elements
- **Don't know yet:** Databases, APIs, authentication, backend logic, state management

### What I Need Explained
- I learn best when things are explained like I'm a complete beginner
- I want to understand WHY things work, not just copy-paste code
- I need real explanations of what each piece of code does

## The Project: Personal Finance Tracker

### What I Want to Build

A full-stack web application that helps me (and eventually others) track personal finances.

### Core Features I Want

1. **Track Income & Expenses**
   - Add transactions with amount, category, date, description
   - Categorize spending (food, sports, entertainment, etc.)
   - See all transactions in a list

2. **Visualize Spending**
   - Charts/graphs showing where money goes
   - Monthly spending breakdown
   - Track spending trends over time

3. **Budgeting**
   - Set monthly budgets for different categories
   - See how much is left to spend
   - Warnings when approaching budget limits

4. **User Authentication**
   - Create an account
   - Log in/log out
   - Each user sees only their own data

### Technical Requirements

**This should be a learning project**, so I want to:
- Use Next.js (since I just learned it)
- Use TypeScript (even though I'm new to it)
- Use Tailwind CSS (I'm familiar with this now)
- Use a real database (Supabase or Firebase recommended)
- Deploy it to Vercel when done
- Use Git/GitHub for version control

### Design Preferences

**Style:** Clean, minimal, professional - NOT childish or corny
- Simple color scheme (prefer blues, grays, clean whites)
- No emojis or playful elements
- Professional typography
- Lots of whitespace
- Inspired by: Stripe, Linear, modern SaaS products

**User Experience:**
- Should be intuitive and simple
- Mobile-friendly (responsive design)
- Fast and smooth

## What I Need Help With

### From the AI Assistant

1. **Break down the project into manageable steps**
   - Don't overwhelm me - I'm a beginner
   - One feature at a time
   - Explain concepts as we go

2. **Teach me full-stack development**
   - How databases work and why we need them
   - How to connect frontend to backend
   - How authentication works
   - How to structure a real application

3. **Write clean, understandable code**
   - Add comments explaining what things do
   - Use clear variable names
   - Explain new concepts before using them

4. **Help me build good habits**
   - Proper Git workflow (commit messages, when to commit)
   - Code organization
   - Best practices for beginners

### What Success Looks Like

By the end of this project, I should:
- ✅ Have a working finance tracker I can actually use
- ✅ Understand how to build full-stack applications
- ✅ Know if I enjoy building products with code
- ✅ Have a portfolio project to show others
- ✅ Be able to build similar projects on my own

## Technical Setup

### Already Installed
- Node.js v24.12.0
- npm 11.6.2
- Git 2.50.1
- VSCode (with Claude Code extension)

### GitHub
- Username: krishsoniii999
- Email: krishsoni1008@gmail.com
- Personal website repo: https://github.com/krishsoniii999/Krish-website

### Vercel
- Already have an account
- Know how to deploy Next.js apps

## Project Timeline

**Goal:** Build this over the next 1-3 months while in school
- Can work on this during free time
- Not in a rush - want to learn properly
- Quality over speed

## Important Notes for the AI

1. **I have NEVER coded before this week** - explain everything
2. **I'm in high school** - I'm smart but inexperienced with development
3. **I learn by understanding** - don't just give me code, explain the "why"
4. **I want this to be real** - not a tutorial project, but something I'll actually use
5. **Start simple** - we can add advanced features later

## Questions I Already Have

- How do I store data so it persists (databases)?
- How do I make sure each user only sees their own data?
- How do I create login/signup functionality?
- How do charts/graphs work in React?
- How do I handle money calculations without rounding errors?

## Getting Started

I'm ready to:
1. Create a new Next.js project for this finance tracker
2. Learn step-by-step how to build each feature
3. Ask questions when I don't understand something
4. Build something I'm proud of

**Let's build this thing.**
